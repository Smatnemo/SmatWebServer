About
I just want it to be known that I am not a fan of web development at the time of writing this README.md..
However I have done this project to practice skills in C++ and C. The first implementation in C was from a source on medium. Check https://medium.com/from-the-scratch/http-server-what-do-you-need-to-know-to-build-a-simple-http-server-from-scratch-d1ef8945e4fa

I thought it was brilliant, simple and straight forward.
I took his implementation and turned it into three classes in C++. A simple Socket Parent and two children: Client and Server Sockets. If you wish to use this repo, feel free to. I am just an enthusiast.
